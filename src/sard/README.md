SARD Script
===========

Sard is still crap, i need redign it using the GC of D language.

Modules
=======
	utils.d 
	Some of usefull functions
	
	classes.d
	Base classes for every thing, every thing dervied from SardObject
	
	objects.d
	Run time objects that can execute.
	
	parsers.d
	Here is the complex of generating parser tree of objects
	
	scanners.d
	Have lexer and scanners, scan the text source code and pass it to the parser
	
	process.d
		Main object to run script    
			

Target Example
==============

```D
x:=10;

	foo:{
		:= 5;
	}
	
	bar:(z: integer){
		:= z * 2;
	}
	
y := x + 10 + foo + bar(x) + { 
		:= 100;
	}

:= y;
```

Sard Tree
======

	Clause 
	{
		OpOperator
		SoObject
		
		execute() -> execute SoObject 
	}	 
				
	Statement: List of Clause {
		execute() -> caluse		
	}
		
	Statements: List of Statement{
		execute() -> for each item execute
	}


------------------------

Block: Statements
	Statement: List!Clause
		Clause: Operator, Object
			Object: Normal | Statement
		
		
Notes
=====

Unit: Objects of run time generated by the scanner and raise in the memory until you free it,
you can run it multiple time, also in the seperated thread

The main object is TsoMain

Object have Execute and Operate
Some objects (like Section) have a Block, and some have one Statement
Block have Statements
Statement: haves Clauses
	Clause: Operator,Modifier,Object

Declare: is define how to call that object, it have Defines and link to the object to execute and call
	Declare is a object of Caluse that call external (or internal) object, until now this object freed by declare and it is wrong :(

Stack: have data for run time execute, you cant share value between thread or multiple execute for the main object
So Stack have Local Variables, Shadow of object
Shadow: it is mirror of object but have extra data about it that we can not save it in the original object,
it is useful for multiexecute.

Prefix
======
Sard: Base class prefix, but i like to change it to somthing else
Srd: global classes inherited from sard
Run: Runtime classes
So: Sard objects, that created when compile the source
Op: Operators objects
