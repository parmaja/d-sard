D Sard Script
=============

It is an object script language not a programming language, but you can use it as programming language.

But "A new language should bring something new to the table.", Until now it is just training to build language or teaching my self D language.

The idea behind it, it is not use any of reserved words it is kind of challenge, only signs (symbols), only objects there is no "void", "var", "let" "function" or "procedure" or even "if", "else" or "while".
But we can implement "if" or "while" internally by define it as internal object (not yet).
