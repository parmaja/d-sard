SARD Script
===========

Sard is still crap, i need redign it using the GC of D language.

Modules
=======
    utils.d 
    Some of usefull functions
    
    classes.d
    Base classes for every thing, every thing dervied from BaseObject
    
    objects.d
    Run time objects that can execute.
    
    parsers.d
    Here is the complex of generating parser tree of objects
    
    scanners.d
    Have lexer and scanners, scan the text source code and pass it to the parser
    
    script.d
        Main object to run script    
            

Target Example
==============

```D

//Single line comment
x:=10;
    
foo:{
    := 5;
}

{* Block comment compiled too as object *}
bar:(z: integer){
    := z * 2;
}

/*
    Multiline comment    
*/

{?preprocess_external_script ?} 
    
y := x + 10 + foo + bar(x) + { 
        := 100;
    }

:= y;
```

Sard Tree
======

    Clause 
    {
        OpOperator
        SoObject
        
        execute() -> execute SoObject 
    }	 
                
    Statement: List of Clause {
        execute() -> caluse		
    }
        
    Statements: List of Statement{
        execute() -> for each item execute
    }



Parser
======

    Instruction 
    


    Parser


------------------------

Block: Statements
    Statement: List!Clause
        Clause: Operator, Object
            Object: Normal | Statement
        
        
Notes
=====

Unit: Objects of run time generated by the tracker and raise in the memory until you free it,
you can run it multiple time, also in the seperated thread

The main object is SoMain

Object have Execute and Operate
Some objects (like Block), and some have one Statement
Block have Statements
Statement: haves Clauses
    Clause: Attributes, Operator, Modifier, Object //not yet now we have only Operator and Object

Declare: is define how to call that object, it have Defines and link to the object to execute and call
    Declare is a object of Caluse that call external (or internal) object, until now this object freed by declare and it is wrong :(

Env: have data for run time execute, you cant share value between thread or multiple execute for the main object
So Stack have Local Variables, Shadow of object
Shadow: it is mirror of object but have extra data about it that we can not save it in the original object,
it is useful for multiexecute.

Prefix
======

Run: Runtime classes
So: Sard objects, that created when compile the source
Op: Operators objects
Script: script that can run
Syntax: for syntax highlighter
